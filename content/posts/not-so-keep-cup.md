A flash back to a darker time, a colder time, a British winter time. I had to commute to London for the day which involved driving for an hour or two (traffic dependant, were leaving ten minutes later can make a half hours difference on arrival) and hopping on the tube for the final 40 minutes across the city itself. If ever there was a time for coffee, this is it.

Dilligently I make myself a rather strong long black, a triple shot topped up with a bit of water, to tide me over during the drive (the keep cup fits so perfectly in the cup holder of the car). I head out to the car with my ruck sack and other bits for the day. When I get to the car I put the keep cup on the roof to find my keys, open the car, and deposit bags into the boot. With horror I watch in slow motion as the keep cup, having melted the ice on the roof, now slides off what appears to be (but apparently is not) a flat roof and smashes onto the ground.

So now I have to clear up the broken glass surrounding the car, remake a coffee in another cup, and deal with the extra traffic running late will cause. Banhams law strikes again.
