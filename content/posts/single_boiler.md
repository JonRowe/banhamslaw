Bitten by Banham’s Law again today, this time as applied to single boiler espresso machines. Managed to leave the boiler in steam mode all morning, resulting in me hurriedly pulling a shot at “get rekt” temperatures.

I realised what was happening about half way through and figured things would be fine. Just an unpleasantly burned shot that I would probably discard.

What I did not figure out in time was that my portafilter was now a pressure vessel. Went to take the handle off only to have it blown clear of the showerhead by the desperately-trying-to-expand steam, blowing weirdly-dry coffee grounds all over my kitchen in the process.

The reason I was making the coffee in such a rush in the first place is that the cleaners had just arrived and I needed to decamp myself and my homeschool pupil downstairs to the office. I made a half-hearted attempt at wiping up the worst of it with a cloth and then slunk away with my tail between my legs.

coda: Espresso shot produced with steam instead of water was actually more drinkable than it had any right to be. TIL!
